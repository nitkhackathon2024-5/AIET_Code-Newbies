## Project_Name

FRAUD DETECTION:
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based fraud detection system to identify and prevent fraudulent activities in financial transactions.

### Libraries Used
Flask: A lightweight web framework for building web applications in Python.
Used for handling routes, requests, and rendering templates.
Command: pip install Flask


Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
Used for reading the CSV file and performing operations on the data (e.g., filtering, describing).
Command:pip install pandas

NumPy: A library for numerical computing.
Although imported, it’s not directly used in this script. However, it's often used with Pandas for handling arrays and mathematical operations.
Command: pip install Numpy


Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
Used to generate the confusion matrix plot.
Command:pip install matplotlib


Seaborn: A data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.
Used to create the heatmap for the confusion matrix.
Command:pip install seaborn


OS: A built-in Python module for interacting with the operating system.


Scikit-learn (sklearn): A popular machine learning library for Python.
train_test_split: For splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
RandomForestClassifier: To build and train the Random Forest classification model.
classification_report, accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, matthews_corrcoef, confusion_matrix: Various metrics and evaluation tools to assess the model's performance.
Command:pip install scikit-learn(sklearn).


Used to create directories, manage file paths, and check for file existence.
